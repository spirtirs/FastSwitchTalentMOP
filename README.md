# FastSwitchTalantMOP
allows you to instantly change talents. The addon is very simple
and also replaces abilities on the panel. For this to work with your class, you need to replace the abilities with yours (according to the talent tier) and also make a macro. For example.
macro name: Tier1Macro or Tier2Macro or Tier3Macro etc.

/cast Bladestorm
/cast Dragon roar
/cast Shockw ave 
and you will have a change in ability on the panel every time you change talent
